## Background

A DAO is an organization that operates on `blockchain technology` and is governed by smart contract rules. The distinguishing feature of a DAO is its decentralization, which allows for transparent and democratic decision-making.

The purpose of this challenge is to explore the potential of DAOs and the blockchain ecosystem, while also pushing oneself to complete a creative project in a short timeframe.
