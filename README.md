*Background*
A DAO is an organization that operates on blockchain technology and is governed by smart contract rules. The distinguishing feature of a DAO is its decentralization, which allows for transparent and democratic decision-making.

The purpose of this challenge is to explore the potential of DAOs and the blockchain ecosystem, while also pushing oneself to complete a creative project in a short timeframe.


*Installation*
This project requires knowledge of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and programming languages like Solidity. Please make sure to have a working knowledge of these concepts before attempting to replicate this project.

If you fail to replicate, feel free to contact me for help.


*Usage*
The project is documented through a LinkedIn series that provides daily updates on progress made towards the creation of the DAO. Each post includes information about the tasks completed that day, as well as insights and lessons learned.
